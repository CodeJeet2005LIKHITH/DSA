    // Explaination
    // First As usual we pass the argument in the format of an integer 
    // if n == 0 then we should because other wise we will enter the negative number which definetly alter over answer
    // how it works
    // verify the answer with n(n+1)/2;
    // first let us take n == 5;
    // it will check whether n == 0 | or n != 0;
    // now in this case n !=0; So it will proceed.
    // 5+func(4); ==> now the recurssion starts --> e
    // our new n will be 4
    // 4+func(3); --> d
    // our new n will be 3;
    // 3 + func(2); --> c
    // our new n will be 2;
    // 2+func(1); --> b
    // our new n will be 1;
    // 1 + func(0); --> a
    // now n == 0 so it return 0;
    // now the function call will be at "a" the value will 1+0 which is 1;
    // now the function call will be at "b" the value will be 2+1 which is 3;
    // now the function call will be at "c" the value will be 3+3  which will be 6;
    // now the function call will be at "d" the value will be 4+6 which will be 10;
    // now the funtion call will be at "e" the value will be 5+10 which will be 15;
    // now it will return this value to the main function ; and the function call will come out from the main function.
